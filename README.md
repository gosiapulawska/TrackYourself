# Track Yourself Application

Track yourself is an application for setting goals on a daily basis and monitoring their achievement. The main purpose of this application is to motivate the user in achieving nutritional, sports and relaxation goals.

## Application Usage

The application uses the firebase database and authentication so any user, who has account in firebase can use the app from any device. In the first step the user has to log in with firebase credentials. After successful authentication the app dashboard will be displayed. On the dashboard we can follow our daily habits changing their status or deleting them. There will be also presented the view with habits and their statuses for the current week. In the top section we can add new habit. The Add Habit page includes the form that has to be completed to add the new habit. The user has to give the name of the habit, select the corresponding category and weekdays for the habit. In the top bar of the app there is Logout button which logs the user out. But it doesn't mean the habits will be deleted. They're stored in firebase database, so they will be visible after the user logs in again.


## Installation Guide and Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
